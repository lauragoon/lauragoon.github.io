        <h1>Learning Machine Learning and Products at Microsoft</h1>
        <p>
            This Saturday, a sweltering heat wave took over NYC as I sat in an air-conditioned room in the Microsoft Store on 5th Ave.
        </p>
        <h2>Part 1: The Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            I was sitting in on a intro to machine learning workshop by Girls Make Apps. After some simple introductions and ice breakers, we got down to the technical business. <br />
            <br />
            At this workshop, we covered…
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>intro lesson to machine learning</li>
            <li>using Microsoft Azure to model breast cancer diagnoses (on a small sample of data)</li>
            <li>using the Clarifai API</li>
            <li>a talk by a rising college freshman about her internship</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Before I came to this workshop, the term “machine learning” had been very intimidating to me; I just imagined hundreds of computer scientists and statisticians staring at millions of lines of code and data all day. I learned that there were actually many tools and resources out that made ML a more reachable idea to understand and utilize. <br />
            <br />
            It was inspiring seeing so many young girls organizing these tech events and talking about how their work in tech. I’m excited to see the presence of more women pursing computer science!
        </p>
        <h2>Part 2: The Tour</h2>
        <p>
            After the workshop was over, we were invited to take a tour of the Microsoft flagship store and experience their products. Here are some highlights: <br />
            <br />
            We got to talk to Pepper, a humanoid robot that responds to both voice and digital input. He even did a little dance for us! I have been reading about how humanoid robots like Pepper have begun to help run fully-functioning stores, so it was a great opportunity when we were able to see in-person how exactly Pepper functions. <br />
            <br />
            We were also given a chance to try out Microsoft’s HoloLens, a self-contained holographic computer you can wear to interact with holograms. When I wore it, I felt like I was wearing a pair of very, very over-sized sunglasses. <br />
            <br />
            The holograms were set in the 3-D space we were in, we were able to literally walk around and through these holograms. To interact with the HoloLens, there were several hand gestures it recognizes (such as clicking and returning to the home menu). “Clicking” around the room allowed us to see how the lens “maps” the 3-D space around us; the closer we were to objects, the clearer the mapping outline was. <br />
            <br />
            I came into this as a very clueless person and walked out with some resources on my belt and an unforgettable experience with today’s latest technology. To think I was planning on staying home because of the heat… I’m glad I didn’t.

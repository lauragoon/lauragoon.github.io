        <h1>A Rise in Instagram Activism</h1>
        <p>
            Social media has become an increasingly popular source of information. According to a study, 48% of Americans use social media as a news source. Instagram, a social media platform created for users to share photos, has recently become a popular source of activism information. Accounts are made solely to create content for activism and posts spreading social awareness is being shared constantly. <br />
            <br />
            The scope of this blog post is narrowed to activism against anti-Asian racism due to the recent surge of attention towards this issue. An increased wave of anti-Asian racism was introduced when the coronavirus, which has origins in China, drastically changed the lives of people around the world. <br />
            <br />
            Similar to activism posts on social media, online marketing campaigns also post with the purpose of reaching new audiences and inciting them into action. I plan to explore the similarities between Instagram activism and online marketing to better understand the role Instagram activism plays in our current society. <br />
            <br />
            Commonly found across many activism posts are a clean font and nice background. Information is displayed as is, with a lack of extraneous detail often found in traditional news articles, another medium of spreading social awareness. One reason for this unique display of information is the goal of reaching a new audience. @soyouwanttotalkabout, a popular Instagram page that “[dissects] progressive politics and social issues in graphic slideshow form,” states that she tries to market her content to “appeal to apolitical people, the ones who'd rather stay out of it and enjoy, like, mimosa pictures”. <br />
            <br />
            Asking questions tends to incites curiosity. Below are two examples of posed questions, the image on the left was created by Tend, a dentistry company. On the right is a post by The Conversationalist, a Gen Z community.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="media/blog/ig-activism-qu1.png" alt="IG post by Tend">
            <img src="media/blog/ig-activism-qu2.png" alt="IG post by The Conversationalist">
            <figcaption>Posts by Tend (left) and The Conversationalist (right)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The question Tend asks revolves around the efficiency of electric toothbrushes and may attract the attention of viewers who care about their oral health, who are the target audience for Tend. The question posed by The Conversationalist is very topical (based on recent news). Viewers have probably heard of the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, and might be curious to learn more. These people would be the target audience of this post, which was posted to spread awareness of this topical issue. Both parties use the idea of a question to engage with the people they want attract and retain. <br />
            <br />
            Facts, concepts proven to be true, are used to provide objectivity. Both parties I am analyzing use the presence of implicit facts to show their credibility as relevant to the topic they are talking about.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="media/blog/ig-activism-facts1.png" alt="IG post by Bulletproof">
            <img src="media/blog/ig-activism-facts2.png" alt="IG post by Liz Kleinrock">
            <figcaption>Posts by Bulletproof (left) and Liz Kleinrock (right)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Although Bulletproof as a company focuses on selling nutrients, demonstrating their knowledge in yoga on the left post, a popular form of practicing wellness, creates trust in their audience by showing they understand what the holistic idea of wellness is. This trust may translate into more Bulletproof nutrient products being sold. On the right, Kleinrock demonstrates her recognition of anti-Asian racism through her knowledge of this law history. By doing this, she portrays herself as a source of objective truth to support the case that anti-Asian racism is real and here in America (as deniers often cite statistics such as high Asian American employment rates and pay wages). Users who see her post may be more likely to start following her content to learn more reliable facts about anti-Asian racism. Both parties use the presence of facts to help establish their own credibility in the space they operate in. This helps with establishing trust among their current audience and possibly engaging with a new following. <br />
            <br />
            The context we see imperative statements most often is when someone of a higher authority instructs their subordinate to do something (e.g. a boss commanding their employee to file some documents). However, the creator of imperative statements also has a role in both social media activism and marketing.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="media/blog/ig-activism-command1.png" alt="IG post by Casper">
            <img src="media/blog/ig-activism-command2.png" alt="IG post by @dont_be_racist_thank_you">
            <figcaption>Posts by Casper (left) and @dont_be_racist_thank_you (right)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The statement on the left by Casper is relevant in context, as Casper sells people the mattress they sleep on in bed. While the use of an imperative statement here is not literal, as in, they do not expect you to immediately go into bed after reading their post, it is used to keep the idea fresh in your mind. If they think long enough, perhaps they feel the need to improve their mattress, and might go to Casper to get one. While the statement by @dont_be_racist_thank_you on the right is meant to be taken a little more literally than the Casper statement, it is not unreasonable to think that the creator of the post knows this probably won't happen the second someone reads their post. The idea of Asians as a model minority (a minority group that is perceived to reach higher than average achievements) is a large obstacle for people to believe anti-Asian racism exists. This post, much like the Casper post, is mainly meant to bring the idea on the top of people's minds to mull on. Imperative statements in these contexts don't work as direct commands, they operate more subtly to guide the audience to ruminate on certain ideas, in a way that these post creators hope will align with the values behind their posts. <br />
            <br />
            Numbers as symbols often convey the idea of objective facts. Mathematics, a subject based on numbers, is popularly known to only have right or wrong answers, rather than an intermediate subjectivity like philosophy might have. The usage of numbers on these Instagram posts helps post creators add credibility to their ideas.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="media/blog/ig-activism-num1.png" alt="IG post by Buffy">
            <img src="media/blog/ig-activism-num2.png" alt="IG post by Very Asian Media">
            <figcaption>Posts by Buffy (left) and Very Asian Media (right)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            A major part of Buffy's, a bedding company, marketing strategy is their focus on being environmentally friendly. This could encourage current customers to continue shopping through Buffy, and could entice new customers to join in on making a positive impact. Instead of filling the posts with accounts of people witnessing blame, the post on the right by Very Asian Media highlights “60%” to show viewers how much people are being impacted by this issue. Both activists and marketers enlist the use of numbers to legitimize the product or issue they stand behind, as well as make it easy for people to visualize and understand the main idea in a short amount of time. <br />
            <br />
            It is important to understand the text behind Instagram activism posts because it creates an avenue for critically analyzing the sources of content. These kinds of posts can easily be found all over the Instagram platform, whether it be through friends sharing or even on Instagram's recommended “Explore” page. Although the issues that posts like these cover are important to discuss, it does not alleviate the post creators from criticism. Instagram activism has received backlash from some people, who call this performative activism, meaning post creators are only participating in activism to increase their social status among peers rather than because of their devotion to the cause. <br />
            <br />
            While this is probably not true for all Instagram activists, the similarities between tactics used by both social media marketing and popular activism posts are many. One interpretation might be that Instagram users have caught on to what spreads information effectively, and are using these techniques to spread important ideas on social awareness. Another interpretation might be that the increased spread of a post will bring more users to their profile, possibly more followers. However, it is necessary to point out the possibility that social media marketers are also taking cues from what is popular among users of the platform they want to advertise on. The ways that both activists and marketers craft Instagram posts are remarkably similar, but causation cannot be proved without further research.

        <h1>My First Grace Hopper: A Recap</h1>
        <p class="blog-container-quote">
            What are the words that define you — who you really aspire to be? Find those words, then live them and share them. <br />
            <br />
            — Dr. Rebecca Parsons
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to attend my first Grace Hopper Celebration this year as a Facebook scholarship recipient. When I first started becoming more involved in technology, I always heard the term “GHC” being thrown around, but never really understand what it was. I never would have imagined how much inspiration and community I experienced at Grace Hopper.
        </p>
        <h2>A Recap</h2>
        <h3>Monday + Tuesday</h3>
        <p>
            I arrived in downtown Houston before the actual conference began for 2 whole days of events with FB employees, as well as the other 49 scholarship recipients. For the next couple of days, we prepared to make the most out of GHC by learning from people's past experiences and getting a better idea of what to expect at the conference. As this would be my first year attending, I was both excited and a little scared of what was to come. <br />
            <br />
            During our off-time, I got a chance to better understand the vast experiences and work of the engineers at FB, being able to talk with them in a more casual setting. It was pretty eye-opening to see the how different (and also how similar) people's paths were to getting to where they are today; it helped me put into perspective how bountiful and present these varied experiences are; they only come up when we get to foster and nurture diverse communities. <br />
            <br />
            Being in this scholarship program with 49 other women in tech has also allowed me to really bond with them, especially since we were mostly in the same boat: female students hoping to make an impact through technology. I'm especially grateful for all the upperclassmen I have met and the encouragement + wisdom they've passed onto me!
        </p>
        <h3>Wednesday + Thursday + Friday</h3>
        <p>
            It was finally the big day: GHC had officially begun. Our first day kicked off with the Opening Keynote, where heard from several amazing women leading change in STEM in the work they do. It was awe-inspiring to see how much effort has been put into leading this movement, and how big the community advocating for women in STEM really is. As I sat in my seat high up in the balcony, I looked around and saw hundreds, probably even thousands of people sitting in the stands, just like me, taking in everything that was being said. At that moment, I felt understood and validated. <br />
            <br />
            After the keynote was finished, we headed towards the main convention center where GHC was being held. Walking into the Career Expo was pretty overwhelming, greeted by a never-ending room filled with booths displaying all their innovative technologies. Next to the Career Expo was also an area showcasing new technologies being developed by various companies. It honestly seemed like a huge museum, but instead of historical artifacts being displayed, it is filled with technology of the future. One of the main reasons why I continue pursing technology is the possibility to help pioneer what the future of our society looks like. Seeing the interesting ways technology is being implemented in current companies keeps me excited for what the future holds, not only for me, but for everyone. <br />
            <br />
            After walking around the huge George R. Brown Convention Center all day, the evening events different companies hosted were a great way to unwind a bit and get a chance to talk to industry engineers in a more relaxed setting. These events were also great opportunities to meet other students attending GHC and share the similar experiences (and nerves!) we got from attending our first couple GHC's.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
            I went into this experience mainly focused on the recruiting aspect, and ended up spending most of my time between the Career Expo and Interview Booths. If I have the opportunity to attend again next year (hopefully!), I plan on spending more time attending the talks/sessions that are also happening throughout the day. There were a couple of talks that caught my eye during registration and I look forward to reliving the Grace Hopper Celebration by watching these recorded talks online when they come out.

        <h1>Learning Machine Learning and Products at Microsoft</h1>
        <p>
            This Saturday, a sweltering heat wave took over NYC as I sat in an air-conditioned room in the Microsoft Store on 5th Ave.
        </p>
        <h2>Part 1: The Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            I was sitting in on a intro to machine learning workshop by Girls Make Apps. After some simple introductions and ice breakers, we got down to the technical business. <br />
            <br />
            At this workshop, we covered…
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>intro lesson to machine learning</li>
            <li>using Microsoft Azure to model breast cancer diagnoses (on a small sample of data)</li>
            <li>using the Clarifai API</li>
            <li>a talk by a rising college freshman about her internship</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Before I came to this workshop, the term “machine learning” had been very intimidating to me; I just imagined hundreds of computer scientists and statisticians staring at millions of lines of code and data all day. I learned that there were actually many tools and resources out that made ML a more reachable idea to understand and utilize. <br />
            <br />
            It was inspiring seeing so many young girls organizing these tech events and talking about how their work in tech. I'm excited to see the presence of more women pursing computer science!
        </p>
        <h2>Part 2: The Tour</h2>
        <p>
            After the workshop was over, we were invited to take a tour of the Microsoft flagship store and experience their products. Here are some highlights: <br />
            <br />
            We got to talk to Pepper, a humanoid robot that responds to both voice and digital input. He even did a little dance for us! I have been reading about how humanoid robots like Pepper have begun to help run fully-functioning stores, so it was a great opportunity when we were able to see in-person how exactly Pepper functions. <br />
            <br />
            We were also given a chance to try out Microsoft's HoloLens, a self-contained holographic computer you can wear to interact with holograms. When I wore it, I felt like I was wearing a pair of very, very over-sized sunglasses. <br />
            <br />
            The holograms were set in the 3-D space we were in, we were able to literally walk around and through these holograms. To interact with the HoloLens, there were several hand gestures it recognizes (such as clicking and returning to the home menu). “Clicking” around the room allowed us to see how the lens “maps” the 3-D space around us; the closer we were to objects, the clearer the mapping outline was. <br />
            <br />
            I came into this as a very clueless person and walked out with some resources on my belt and an unforgettable experience with today's latest technology. To think I was planning on staying home because of the heat… I'm glad I didn't.

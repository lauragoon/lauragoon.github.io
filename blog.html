        <h1>Learning Machine Learning and Products at Microsoft</h1>
        <p>
            This Saturday, a sweltering heat wave took over NYC as I sat in an air-conditioned room in the Microsoft Store on 5th Ave.
        </p>
        <h2>Part 1: The Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            I was sitting in on a intro to machine learning workshop by Girls Make Apps. After some simple introductions and ice breakers, we got down to the technical business. <br />
            <br />
            At this workshop, we covered… <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>intro lesson to machine learning</li>
                <li>using Microsoft Azure to model breast cancer diagnoses (on a small sample of data)</li>
                <li>using the Clarifai API</li>
                <li>a talk by a rising college freshman about her internship</li>
            </ul> <br />
            <br />
            Before I came to this workshop, the term “machine learning” had been very intimidating to me; I just imagined hundreds of computer scientists and statisticians staring at millions of lines of code and data all day. I learned that there were actually many tools and resources out that made ML a more reachable idea to understand and utilize. <br />
            <br />
            It was inspiring seeing so many young girls organizing these tech events and talking about how their work in tech. I’m excited to see the presence of more women pursing computer science!
